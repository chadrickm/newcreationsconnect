# New Creations Connect

A mobile app for the church to view and plan for upcoming multi-congregational meetings (Family Camps, Advances, etc.)

## Running Locally

1. You will need the latest version of Node and NPM on your machine. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org).
2. Clone the repository (I use [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) to manage git).

Use local npm packages

```
npm install
```

Install Ionic and Cordova
```
npm install -g ionic
```

For testing in the browser

```
ionic serve
```

For android

```
ionic platform add android
ionic run android
```

For iOS

```
ionic platform add ios
ionic run ios
```
